# Repost Instagram App

This project contains a minimal Android application skeleton. The app includes several activities:

- `MainActivity` as a landing page
- `LoginActivity` for user authentication
- `UserProfileActivity` to show user details
- `DashboardActivity` to display Instagram posts fetched from official accounts
- `ReportActivity` for viewing repost links

The project uses Gradle Kotlin DSL. To build the project you would typically run:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Additional implementation is required to integrate Instagram APIs and handle authentication.
